A.  ANALYSIS METHODOLOGY USED:

==============================

All my analysis was performed using the Brown-UMBC Reinforcement Learning and Planning (BURLAP) java code library. However, since I made various modifications to the standard BURLAP library, I have included a version of the library that contains my modifications






B.  SETTING UP BURLAP:

======================

To set up the included BURLAP library for use with Eclipse, simply import the library as an existing project in Eclipse. Please follow the import instructions at  http://help.eclipse.org/kepler/index.jsp?topic=%2Forg.eclipse.platform.doc.user%2Ftasks%2Ftasks-importproject.htm
